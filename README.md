# Assignment 07 Description
Create a Flutter
application that consists of the following:

- A stateful widget called ProductList that displays a list of products.
- Each product should have a name, price, and a "Buy Now" button.
- Implement a counter for each product that increments by 1 every time the "Buy Now" button is pressed.
- When the counter for a product reaches 5, show a dialog box with the message "Congratulations! You've bought 5 {Product Name}!" Replace {Product Name} with the actual name of the product.
- Use the ListView widget to display the product list.
- Implement navigation to a new page called CartPage when the user presses a "Go to Cart" button.
- The CartPage should display the total number of products the user has bought.
